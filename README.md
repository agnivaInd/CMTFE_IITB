Codes for Computational  Methods in Thermal and Fluids Engineering. These are the codes that I have developed as part of my ME 704 course during my MTech at IIT Bombay. Codes are written in MATLAB and are highly modular and written in MATLAB.

[Assignment 1] Involves developing a code for evaluating the Taylor polynomial to a desired degree

[Assignment 2] Involves writing of a few codes on different root finding algorithms such as Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method and the Secant Method. Results are displayed in the output, and the residue is stored in CSV files.

[Assignment 3] Involved writing of codes for performing Gauss Elimination with and without pivoting. Results are displayed in the output.
