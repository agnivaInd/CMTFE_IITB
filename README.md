Codes for Computational  Methods in Thermal and Fluids Engineering. These are the codes that I have developed as part of my ME 704 course during my MTech at IIT Bombay. Codes are written in MATLAB and are highly modular and written in MATLAB.

[Assignment 1] Code for evaluating the Taylor polynomial to a desired degree

[Assignment 2] Codes on different root finding algorithms such as Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method and the Secant Method. Results are displayed in the output, and the residue is stored in CSV files.

[Assignment 3] Codes for performing Gauss Elimination with and without pivoting. Results are displayed in the output.

[Assignment 4] Codes for performing interpolation using the Quadratic Polynomial Interpolation, Newton's Divided Difference Method and the Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation method. Results are displayed in a plot, comparing the performance of the different schemes. 

[Assignment 5] Codes for solving 1D Transient Heat Conduction Equation, using the FTCS, BTCS and the DuFort Frenkel Schemes. Results are displayed in seperate plots, comparing the performance of different schemes.

[Assignment 6] Codes for solving 2D Transient Heat Conduction Equation, using the FTCS scheme with 4 different boundary conditions at 4 walls. Results are displayed as an animation showing the development of the thermal profile.

[Assignment 7] Codes for solving the 1D Wave Equation using the Lax-Wendroff and Euler BTCS schemes. Results are stored in CSV files, and animations are done using the data from those CSV files. 

[Assignment 8] Code for solving the steady state lid driven cavity problem. Results displayed are validated with data from literature in an additional plot in the code.
